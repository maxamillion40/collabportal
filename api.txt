ScratchCollabs API reference
============================
Introduction
------------
The API for Scratchcollabs offers an object-oriented way to extend the functionality of the CollabPortal.
The PHP API is available on all pages, provided that loader.php has already been called.
Please seperate content-pages and dedicated scripts strictly! Put content-pages (those with HTML in it) in the home directory (./), dedicated scripts without HTML output into ./libs.
If you need to call a script in /libs, link to action.php?youraction and add the following snippet before the header() calls at the bottom:
	if(isset($_GET["youraction"]))	{	
		include_once("libs/youraction.php");
		exit;
	}
